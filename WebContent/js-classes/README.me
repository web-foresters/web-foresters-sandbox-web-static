#Welcome to this Sandbox:
#JS Classes

##This module is for playing with different methods of creating and modifying how JavaScript functions are defined.

###The 1st textarea contains the code for playing with these methods, and loads with some examples to tryout.

###The 2nd textarea is a convenient console for these scripts, when the logToConsole(<msg>) is called.  That method by default also forwards to console.log(<msg>);
